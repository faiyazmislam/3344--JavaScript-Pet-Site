                            In our first lab, our assignment is to create to this entire website and its first four webpages. We can only use HTML and CSS.
                            The webpages we have to build are a home page, labs page, a page for personal information, and a resume page. The home page has to have a header,
                            footer, and a navigation bar. The labs page needs to have a layout for us to link our labs throughout the semester. We also have to create a folder
                            for the images that we use.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I have used some HTML and CSS in the past, but this assignment is the most I've used both of them.
                            Some of the techniques I employed in this lab include using floats to style the home page, adding multiple links
                            throughout the project, adding several images to a couple pages, and creating a table in HTML and styling it with CSS
                            in the labs page. I've never styled a table with CSS before, so I watched this <a href="https://youtu.be/dK27jWKtJxs">video</a> to learn how.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When I first started this assignment, I could not figure out how to format the layouts of the pages. I watched a few videos and still had trouble understading.
                            I thought the lab was tedious then, but Professor Pascucci realized that he didn't finish teaching us CSS layout and finished the lecutre.
                            His examples during class made the process much easier to understand and I managed to finsih the lab within a few hours after.

                            In this assignment, we had two tasks to complete. The first task was to create a single responsive web page
                            that was comprised of four separate virutal pages and a navigation bar. The first page was the
                            had the header and introductory text to the site's topic. The second page was composed of
                            three different sections. Each section had a title, an image with a caption, and some text. The next page
                            had a form made of ten questions using various html controls. The final page of site was a gallery of six
                            images. In desktop mode, there are two rows of three images. In mobile form, the images all stack on top. Second part
                            of the assignment required me to modify my original site and make all the pages responsive.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This assignment made me search for lots of example code and watch multiple videos to understand many different
                            elements of HTML and CSS. From this lab, I learned how to implement features to make a web page and its elements
                            responsive. I also learned how to create a form in html and how each type of control works and is created. I can now
                            additionally make image galleries that can stack in smaller screen sizes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This lab was long. There was not only a lot of time I had to invest into learning the different techniques and coding
                            but also a lot of time spent actually coding it and playing with CSS to create the pages I wanted. The second part of
                            but also a lot of time spent actually coding it and playing with CSS to create the pages I wanted. The second part of
                            the assignment, the modification of the main site, took the longest because I had to basically redo all the pages
                            so that I could make them better suited for responsiveness. Despite the tediousness, the separate single web page
                            was fun to make and it was intersting to see that I could make forms within HTML and actually collect data with it.

                            In this lab, we had to create a pet adoption site. The site had to let the user choose between three categories of animals:
                            birds, cats, and dogs. When the user clicks on the search button, they should be able to see the animals up for adoption.
                            Each animal came with an image, description, and a button for adoption. The user can see which animals they chose to adopt at
                            the bottom section of the page. This site was created with HTML, CSS, and JS.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This site used JavaScript to implement the buttons and show the animals. I watched a lot of videos and looked at some example
                            sites to help me understand the language better. I created many functions to cut down on the amount of code as many
                            events were repeated numerous times throughout the program. I have a better grasp of JS now that I've spent several
                            hours coding it within this lab.

                        <p>
                            JavaScript is a difficult language to understand at first after spending years coding in languages like C# and Java.
                            I had many errors throughout the programming of this site, and many times JS would not tell me the issue, so I had
                            to look through all my code and try to find the problem. I watched a lot of videos to help me understand this language
                            better. I think I have a better understanding of the language now, especially when it comes to creating functions
                            and attaching events.

                            In this lab, we had to create an upgraded version of the previous lab's pet adoption site. Alongside the home page for
                            the pet site, there is now a page for the user to add pets to the site, a page to let the user modify the data of the pets or
                            delete them, and a donation page for the user to add donations to the site. The home page is identical to the previous lab
                            in that it allows the user to view pets of whatever type they want.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This site, like the previous lab, uses JavaScript as the main source of code. Alongside the advanced JS, the site also implements some
                            JQuery. Local storage amd JSON are also used to keep record of the pets on the site as well as the pets that the user chose to adopt. JavaScript is used
                            in every page of the site. Unlike the previous lab, there is now a class to create pet objects. Many functions are implemented and attached
                            to the numerous buttons and textboxes for data input. This site additionally validates the data that the user inputs. Textboxes will check for empty
                            inputs and whether the user has entered a number. When adding the brithdate of animals, the user is unable to choose future dates.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This lab has proven to be by far the most time consuming assignment in the class. My total lines of JavaScript in my site is about 1000. The home page was not
                            too difficult to create as most of it is from the previous lab. The add page and the donations page were also not too difficult to create
                            and they had the least code per page. The modification page, however, went through many trials and errors. This page took the most amount of time
                            to figure out. The remove operation was not too difficult to deal with, but the modification option took much time to create a solution for. I did not
                            think that using JS was as annoying as last lab because I now have lots of experience with it and can find my coding errors faster. Overall, I honestly
                            am pretty proud of the site that I ultimately created. The use of local storage makes it behave like a normal site that I use everyday.
